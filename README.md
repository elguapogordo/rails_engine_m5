README and project are in progress. This is a revisited school project that I would like to hit all features and extensions. It will feature Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord, PostgreSQL, REST API, and deployment with continuous integration to Heroku.

# Rails Engine
This is a back end API based application for the front end test application Rails Driver. It uses Ruby on Rails with a PostgresQL database and has the following endpoints:  
  *

All responses are formatted to JSON:API v1.0 specifications.  
Tested with SimpleCov `351 / 351 LOC (100.0%) covered.`

## Environment
* set up with `rails new rails_engine_m5 -d postgresql -M -T --api --skip-spring`
* Ruby version 2.5.3
* Rails version 6.0.3.4
* unlikely to use FastJSON API gem (no longer maintained)
